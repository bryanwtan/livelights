###Arduino Sound Responsive LED Lights

This was my first ever coding project and remains one of the most entertaining. Any audio source like an iPod can be analyzed by the graphic equalizer chip (MSGEQ7). Sampling the output tells the Arduino how intense the music is at specific frequencies. Each strip of LED lights is paired with a frequency range common to musical instruments like a bass drum, cymbals, or singer's voice.
